# Railway-Management-System
A railway management system will serve as the foundation for this database management systems project. It has a variety of items, including different train kinds, stations throughout the city, and the complete train timetable, which will include the time the train departs from each station, as well as its destination and the time it arrives there.
This helps automate and streamline the management of ticketing, scheduling, and maintenance.
The project uses SQL as the backend database and Windows Forms in C# as the front-end framework for building this desktop application.
